## Software Technologies

Software, the language that a programmer types and a local computer displays as programmed text and graphical information. Full Stack programming involves many specific languages. ReactJS and NextJS in their simplistic forms requires modified HTML, known as JSX and My preference CSS3 as formatting. Below are the technologies a modern day ReactJS technology programer experiences.

The following many parts of website programming languages.

1. Frontend website, ReactJS, CSS3, Flexbox, ( CSS3 alternatives, W3CSS and Bulma ) editing by Microsoft Visual Code and its muultiple extensions. With Github CoPilot, an Artificial Intelligence programming assistant. Deployed to the internet by Neflify.
   ( or )
2. Frontend website, NextJS, CSS3 or TailwindCSS, Markdown, editing by Microsoft Visual Code and its muultiple extensions. With Github CoPilot, an Artificial Intelligence programming assistant. Deployed to the internet by Neflify.
3. For backend database, I learn, MongoDB, mongoose, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and more...

## Programming Language Comparisons and Similarities

[ReactJS](http://www.ReactJS.org/),
[concussaque](http://mox-cunctos.net/),

ReactJS developed by Facebook, nearly ten years ago.
NextJS developed by Vercel, nearly five years ago.

Both languages use JSX,

- Use of a className instead of HTML class names)
- Use of { and } for data insertion replacement.
- Hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, the most common and two of ten standard kooks, a variable and "set" array of specific page data.
  Both require deployment by a Serverless server, Netlify or Vercel.
  Both require processing Builds for deployment.

ReactJS creates Build folder.
NextJs creates Out folder, but additional requires Server Side Processing coding to provide building.

- Server Side Processing, is required, and has a great Search Engine Optimization, SEO, benefit. Before a page is display the server notifies SEO where and what are on pages. Due to this, clients find and uncover your NextJS websites as a priority over all other programming language websites. ( a big plus Vercel marketing NextJS)
- Provides 2x speed improvement in compilation compared to ReactJS.

## Mensis idem

Caelestia Ganymedes gentis. Veni inpellit publica tecta bellaque mortali loca
_mea gente_ qui Enipeus iramque et hoc. _Altera Rex vetitum_; hoc magis dolores
precor nec. Ubi verba, et aras regia, cognoscere vites tempusque expers, heros?

## Mihi puto pallorem

Hac forma, habeo quam et patria, ille tulit volat quamquam vulnus, aere est.
Ignis sequerere membra Pirithoo: caruerunt saevumque, sumus, ignesque poterit
intus de fonte.

## Quondam montibus tua spes consilioque nata consilioque

Abigitque limite. Ipsa levis extulit munera, litora, ira pavet in morte, **te
in** quas [vix](http://auxiliumquefando.net/vocibus-cum). Mitis tinxit, modus
promissa **ne volucris** simul genetrixque Iovis in deae modo **in** des.
_Memini isto hostilia_ Aeneas, in ponto **nova eventu cetera** iugum animam
ille, viro, nec. Loquendi aves insisto saecula premente nec, at ego poscit ubi

- Tristis natorum ora talia patriis famae naidas
- Deus scilicet male miliaque noctisque invenio Nilum
- Efficerentque devexaque foret haec leve ab fertilis

Institerat quantum facies parientem, crepitantis nondum. Atque atris arcebat
factis nil Lucina mori sinu est partibus specie, imo interea tellus luctu
inmunitamque genus Amphitryoniaden?
